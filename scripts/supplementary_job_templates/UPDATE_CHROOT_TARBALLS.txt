UPDATE_CHROOT_TARBALL JOB SETUP:

In the current folder you can find also the files:
    - UPDATE_CHROOT_TARBALLS_config.xml
    - UPDATE_CHROOT_TARBALLS_TRIGGER_config.xml
They contain the config.xml template for two jobs to keep the chroot tarballs up-to-date.

UPDATE_CHROOT_TARBALLS:
    This one is a matrix job to with two axes for the ubuntu version and the architecture.

UPDATE_CHROOT_TARBALLS_TRIGGER:
    This job allows you to trigger a single entry in the matrix from the job above.

To set up those jobs you have to copy each one in a folder with the job name inside /var/lib/jenkins/jobs on your Jenkins master node.
Then replace the placeholders in the files with you data:
- (!!UBUNTU!!): ubuntu version, e.g. lucid, oneiric, ..
- (!!ARCHITECTURE!!): system architectures, e.g. amd64, i386, ..
- (!!FORKOWNER!!): Fork owner of github repository jenkins_setup
- (!!TARBALL_SSH_ADDRESS!!): Ssh address of location where tarballs are or will be stored,
  e.g. USER@SERVER:LOCATION
- (!!TARGET_URL!!): URL address of target platforms yaml file, e.g.
  https://raw.github.com/ros/rosdistro/master/releases/targets.yaml

Finally reload the Jenkins configuration from the disk and the jobs will be present and ready to work.
