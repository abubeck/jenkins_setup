- Script for master to automatically set up a folder called
  'jenkins-config' containing all necessary configurations and files
  needed for the communication between master and slaves
- Script for slaves to setup configuration files for the current
  environment containing things like Jenkins-server name and node label
  and also enable a password-free ssh-connection to the server
